## Summary

This repository contains the code for the Edward Gunning's thesis Chapters 1 and 2.

* The $\textsf{R}$ codes to generate the example and create the figures are contained in the [code](code) folder :open_file_folder:.

* The figures are generated as .TeX files using the R package `{tikzDevice}` and stored in the [figures](figures) folder :open_file_folder:. The file [figures.tex](figures/figures.tex) file :page_facing_up: compiles them from .TeX to .pdf.

* This repository is synced with Overleaf to render the [figures.tex](figures/figures.tex) file :page_facing_up:.

* Some diagrams were made manually using Powerpoint and rendered to pdf. In this case, both the .pptx and .pdf files are stored in the repository.

## Example Figure

(hasn't been rendered in .tex, so labels still display LaTeX code)
