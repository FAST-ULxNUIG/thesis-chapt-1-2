Edward Gunning Thesis Chapter 1 and 2
================

## Summary

This repository contains the code for Edward Gunningâ€™s Ph.D.Â thesis
Chapters 1 and 2.

- The $\textsf{R}$ code to generate the examples and create the figures
  are contained in [code :open_file_folder:](code).

- The figures are generated as TeX files using the R package
  `{tikzDevice}` and stored in [figures :open_file_folder:](figures).
  The file [figures.tex](figures/figures.tex) file :page_facing_up:
  compiles them from .tex to .pdf.

- This repository is synced with Overleaf to render the
  [figures.tex](figures/figures.tex) file :page_facing_up:.

- Some diagrams were made manually using Powerpoint and rendered to pdf.
  In this case, both the .pptx and .pdf files are stored in the
  repository.
